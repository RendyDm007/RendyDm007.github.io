					The long-awaited follow-up to the Kingdom Hearts series finally lands early next year, a few days in Japan before everywhere else. What’s a tiny bit more waiting going to do to dissuade Kingdom Hearts after all this time, though? Kingdom Hearts 3 looks like the most ambitious entry in the series to date, until Kingdom Hearts 3.2: Jazz Quartet Inferno, of course.

			<h2>RESIDENT EVIL 2 REMAKE | JANUARY 25TH, 2019</h2>

			<article >
					Developer: Capcom<br>
					Publisher:Capcom<br>
					Platform(s): PC, PS4, XB1<br>
					<br>
					It would have been easy for Capcom to half-ass their long-gestating Resident Evil 2 remake. Not the case: it appears as if they’re going all out on this one. Featuring modern controls and visuals, the re-imagining of the classic will show limb degradation in all its visceral glory, as well as some new areas not shown in the original. If it’s half as excellent as the Gamecube remake of the first game, itself one of the best horror games ever, Resident Evil 2 should be just fine.
					<br>
					UPDATE: it’s very good. From our Resident Evil 2 review:<br>
					“Resident Evil 2 is, quite simply, one of the best remakes of all-time. Capcom have nailed their new vision of a classic just like they did back in 2002 by modernising a decades old game to feel like something completely fresh. Whether you want to take a trip down memory lane or are just experiencing the disconcerting decadence of the police station for the first time, Resident Evil 2 is the first essential purchase of 2019.”

			<h2>TRIALS RISING | FEBRUARY 12TH, 2019</h2>

					Trials Rising is going to have to do some pretty spectacular things to stand out in February. By far the smallest of the big games releasing during the month, RedLynx have been listening to fan feedback about where they went wrong with Fusion. While it may appeal to fans of the series, the best call for Ubisoft at this point may be to nudge Rising into the next month’s release window. What’s that? It has loot boxes? Oh. Oh no.

						Developer: Spike Chunsoft<br>

						Platform(s): PC, PS4, XB1<br>
						<br>
						Shonen Jump games have never reach a massive audience in the West, but thanks to the success of the likes of Dragon Ball FighterZ (and also everyone now being an anime fan), Jump Force could for the niche what World did for Monster Hunter. Packed with iconic heroes and tantalising match-ups, Jump Force brings the big guns from the likes of DBZ, Naruto, One Piece, and more.
